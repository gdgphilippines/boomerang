									<h3>Rules and Requirements</h3>
									<ul style="line-height: 175%">
										<li><b>Registration & Team Size</b>. Only registered teams will be only to compete. Participants must register as a team or individual and each group can be composed of 2 members maximum.</li>
										<li><b>Procedure</b>. In this event, participants will be given 2 days to develop an app on the theme to be given that day. Staying overnight is not allowed ( must vacate by 10PM, come back by 7AM the following day)</li>
										<li><b>Platform and Technology Stacks</b>. Mobile, web or any platform app would do. You may use any programming language you prefer.</li>
										<li><b>No Offsite Development</b>. Codes must be written in the venue during the event hours. Public APIs and open source codes are exceptions.</li>
										<li><b>Build Something New</b>. Can’t repackage your existing app. Don’t just change a tiny feature and call it a new app</li>
										<li><b>Track Your Code</b>. We highly recommend the use of Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. Also helps us when doing code audit.</li>
										<li><b>Demo</b>. No powerpoints/keynotes allowed. Build and demonstrate a working app, don’t just show us screenshots. Participants will present their hack from their respective tables. Judges will roam around to individually check and test each app.</li>
										<li><b>Code Reviews</b>. Top finalists will have their code audited to make sure it’s all new and legit, by a developer appointed by GDG Philippines and Judges. Your code belongs to you and we won’t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win.</li>
